✋ Pro-Hand-Gesture-System

Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition & Interactive Control Engine

Pro-Hand-Gesture-System is a robust, real-time hand gesture recognition framework designed to enable gesture-driven interaction with digital systems. Built using modern web technologies, it allows intuitive control of 3D visuals, UI elements, and camera movement through natural hand motions captured via a standard webcam.

This project is ideal for interactive graphics, AI demos, creative coding, computer vision research, and human–computer interaction (HCI) applications.
